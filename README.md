Listricks is an Android app for organizing and sharing shopping lists.
Me and my partner Dor Peleg created Listricks during an Android App Development course by **Lightricks**.

**Front End:** Created with **Android Studio** and **Kotlin** (MVVM arcitecture, RecyclerViews, Permissions, Content Providers). 

**Back End:** Serverless with the services of **AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFormation)**, written with **Python**. 

**API:** Created **RESTful API** using API Gateway.
